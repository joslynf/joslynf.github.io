This is an evaluation of factors affecting violence, property-related, and other trivial crimes from 2020 to 2021 in Boston.

Through evaluating various factors affecting violence, including shooting, property-related, and other more trivial crimes, we found out that all crimes are more likely to happen during night and less busy hours, away from streetlight and traffic, and in neighborhoods less educated and affluent. Distinctly, whereas violent crimes are related to weather factors, property crimes are more dependent on distances from streetlights and traffic, and also differentiate from the rest with respect to local residential structures.
